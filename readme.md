# Cat Programming Language v2

This is a reimplementation of the Cat language, with fewer features and a more precise specification and type system than the original, this time in TypeScript (the original was C#). 

I'm developing the [type inference module](https://github.com/cdiggins/type-inference) and the [parsing module](https://github.com/cdiggins/myna-parser) as separate standalone packages that can be reused in other language projects.
